				This is my digital clock I made through Action Script 3.0. It consists of two class<br/>
				files, one that draws the digits and one that updates the digits according to a 'ticker'<br/>
				that receives the time from the computer.
			</p>

			<p>
				Finding out how to draw the digits onto the clock was very straightforward, the problem<br/>
				was finding out how to remove them and redraw them so they don't all become 8's <br/>
				(because an 8 digit has every segment in the digit drawn). This was solved by<br/>
				utilizing the function this.graphics.clear() in the correct position to remove<br/>
				the digit before drawing another one.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				After that was solved, the next problem was finding out how to convert a two<br/>
				digit numbers like "12' into two one digit numbers so that the digits can be<br/>
				drawn. This was solved by using modulo (%) to divide the numbers by 10 and <br/>
				give the remainder. For  the example 12, 12 % 10 would give us 2. This is<br/>
				would provide us with the necessary digit to draw the last number of our<br/>
				time.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				I actually did something really stupid with drawing the digits, as I did the<br/>
				above for the LAST digits of my time, but NOT my FIRST digits. I came up with<br/>
				the absolutely ridiculous solution of defining every 10 digit interval for<br/>
				what digit to draw for the 10's place. An example is to check if the hour <br/>
				is less that 20 and greater than 9, if this is true, draw a "1" in the 10's <br/>
				place. If the hour is less than 25 and greater then 19, draw a "2" in the <br/>
				10's place. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				This carried on for MANY lines of code...

			<p>
				This is my digital clock with the added functionality of displaying milliseconds.<br/>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				It was a relatively easy addition, as the code to draw and receive the current<br/>
				milliseconds was almost the exact same as the rest of the digits.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				A difference that did come up was that if you trace() or print the milliseconds,<br/>
				you might get a number with three digits instead of two because milliseconds are<br/>
				a thousandths of a second, not a hundredth! 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				To follow up with that, my stupid solution was to define every 100 second interval<br/>
				instead of just using % to find the first number of the milliseconds.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				I am regret.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The main problem was the fact that the milliseconds couldn't update<br/>
				fast enough because a thousandths of a second is pretty fast! To fix this, I raised<br/>
				the frame rate until a milliseconds looked like they were going "fast enough".

			<p>
				The next addition to my digital clock was 'shadows' in the background. The purpose<br/>
				of this is to imply that there are segments that are not being used to display the<br/>
				current time. It is a purely aesthetic addition, but probably more useful for actual<br/>
				physical digital clocks.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				It was quite simple, as all I did was make a separate class to draw the shadows.<br/>
				It basically drew a darkened eight digit using the exact same drawing commands as<br/>
				the other digits.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The main problem that came up was the shadows were drawn on top of the digits!<br/>
				This just made every digit display a darkened 8. The quick and easy fix was to<br/>
				draw the shadows first, and then have the actual digits drawn on top of the shadows.<br/>
				This was done by simply rearranging the order of the code.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Someone who is really good at observing things may notice that the milliseconds<br/>
				of this clock eventually start to not match with the milliseconds of the above<br/>
				clock. I believe this is because the computer really can't update the digits fast<br/>
				enough at the EXACT same time, so we eventually see nuances.

			<p>
				The last addition to my digital clock was an artistic background. It was fun<br/>
				coming up with an idea to put my clock on and I am quite satisfied with the results.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The background is dynamite, implying that this is a time bomb! Little do people<br/>
				know it is just a harmless clock!
			</p>
			
			<p>
				I live life on the edge.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				This file is MASSIVE because the clock is actually the same size as the other<br/>
				clocks on this page. I just resized the entire stage to fit it in the same area<br/>
				as the rest. You may notice the effects of this, as if you reload the page<br/>
				here, the file takes about a second to start.

				Doom is imminent, but when?
